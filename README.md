**Team to-dos**

*Arka - finish transporters sign up sequence, connect everything 

*Jeremy - Make profile editable, telling Arka what to do 

*Joyce - Fix the schedules

*Kristina - Poster, organize Sunday, figure out "Yes this was done" Sequence / confirm completion of order, troubleshoot problems generally 

*Kylee - Support 



Everyone for your sequences: 

*Make that all the back buttons work

*Make sure error message thrown if field left empty (because that will cause a null pointer error)

Other things that need to be done (Jeremy, may ask you to pick up some of this) 

*Convert between amount of produce and truck space
Figure out radius from a location to determine who should be listed as available.


* Add progress bar to bottom of sign-up sequence - whoever figures it out first

From the client: 
* Need to implement the changes to the welcome screen as discussed. 

* On location, we really liked the drop pins and the ability to change locations/quantities.  An idea, if there is connectivity: when a farmer is inputting the photo of their farm as part of their profile, can we have a pin automatically dropped for the farm (avoiding the need for them to input an address?)

* On the transporter side, we need to get a demo that would cover what transporters can do (as we now have with farmers).  This would include checking places to pick up (the match) plus possible the "how full is your truck" functionality for transporters, if doable

* On the transporter side, we would like to see an uploaded picture of truck, license plate, and upload driver picture

* Last for now, once the driver and farmer have agreed on pickup, we will want the ability to have notifications and confirmations related to the finished transaction -- to show being on my way, to say one or the other party might be delayed, to send word that "I'm arriving" or "will be late".  We would like to see the dummy versions of those such as: confirm day of/change, notifications about delays/arrivals via SMS, Phone Contact via the app.
